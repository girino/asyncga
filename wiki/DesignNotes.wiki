I am thinking of implementing the operations (mating, mutating, dying, etc) as a set of operators that apply iteratively over the population as a whole.

dying probability should be dependent on population size. Maybe use some quadratic formula to calculate the limit age, then a gaussian probability to decide if individuals must die!
